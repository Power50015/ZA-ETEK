## WHY HTML & BOOTSTARP?

Why we're exporting HTML in the first place.…It's an open standard, so it's not goanna taken away…by
any one, single company.…It's the language of the web, … so it's already viewable on every modern
browser.…It's text-based, so it's easy to open, easy to edit, …it's not really hiding much from you.…In
addition to HTML being universal at its core, …it's also an easy format to port…into other formats such
as mobile apps…
